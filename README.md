# cs229-final-project
Spring 2019. Listen to your data: Turning chemical dynamics simulations into music

This repository contains code and data used in our final project for CS 229 at Stanford University, Spring 2019. Our goal was to generate music based on data from a chemical dynamics simulation. Please see the report or poster for more information.

Authors: Austin Atsango, Soren Holm, K. Grace Johnson

data: chemical dynamics data and music data in MIDI format
models: scripts and Python notebooks for machine learning models we used
utils: scripts for processing data and analyzing results
